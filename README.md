# kody2.0
The second generation Kody Bot, inspired by Kody 1.0, this time by more friends :)

### Here's a quick rundown of how this project works
**__pycache__** is an autogenerated file that we do not need to touch or worry about
**cogs** contains each module that each of us will be working on, either separately or in groups
**myenv** is a virtual environment with all of the projects dependencies (or imports). Rather than download the libraries on your PC, you will run this virtual environment from terminal
**.gitignore** prevents the bot.py file from being uploaded to discord, because it contains a secret token
